            <p className="bio--content">Since late 2021, I have been working on learning Web development. I began using Udemy courses in my spare 
                time.After realizing I needed to commit more I left my employer and focused on it full time in late 2023.
                I found Scrimba in January 2024 and began their Frontend Developer Career Path. It was with Scrimba that
                I really grew in condience and ability.</p>
