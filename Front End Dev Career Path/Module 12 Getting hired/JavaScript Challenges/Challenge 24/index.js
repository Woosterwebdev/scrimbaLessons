/* Night at the Scrimbies 

It's time for the Scrimbies, a prestigious award show for podcast hosts.
We need to assemble a list of podcast hosts so we can start handing out awards. 

Write a function that takes in the podcast data and
returns a flat array of podcast hosts. There are quite a few ways to approach
this, but try solving the problem using reduce(). 

Once you have a flat array of hosts, write a second function to randomly assign each host a prize
from the awards array. 

Example output: ["🏆 Alex Booker", "⭐ Bob Smith", "💎 Camilla Lambert" ...] 

*/ 
const awards = ["🏆", "⭐", "💎", "🥇", "👑"];

function getHosts(data){
   return data.reduce((a, b) => {
    return a.concat(b.hosts)
   }, [])
}

function assignAwards(data){
    return getHosts(data).map((host) => `${awards[Math.floor(Math.random() * awards.length)]} ` + host)
}


console.log(getHosts(podcasts));
console.log(assignAwards(podcasts));
